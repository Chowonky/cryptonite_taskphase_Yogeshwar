## Who are you?
- went over all the source files, found nothing useful
- since the website says `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!` I changed the request's `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/130.0.0.0 Safari/537.36` header to `User-Agent: PicoBrowser` (basically changed the user agent from firefox to picobrowser)
- And now the website says `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`
- I somehow have to manipulate it into thinking that I'm directly visiting the site, but how?
- searched how to do it
- added a blank `Referer` tab to the request, nothing happened though.
- instead of blank `Referer`, used `http://mercury.picoctf.net:46199/` itself as the referer and now the website says `Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.`
- So now I have make it think its 2018
- added a `Date` header to change the year
- It now says `I don't trust users who can be tracked`
- asked gpt to list all possible tracking headers
- tried removing combinations of them and updated `Connection: keep-alive` to `close`, no success
- stuck at `I don't trust users who can be tracked`
- `Referer`, `Date`, `User-Agent` can be used for tracking but removing them takes me back to previous messages.
- my current request: 
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:46199/
Date: 2018
Cache-Control: 
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
Accept: 
Accept-Encoding: 
Accept-Language: 
Connection: close
```
- removing the `Accept` headers did nothing either
- thinking of using vpn
