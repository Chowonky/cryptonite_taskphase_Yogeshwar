## where are the robots

- there's no page source code
- i tried messing with the css code,     but got nothing
- ended up googling this as well

`robots.txt` ->

In the context of web exploitation, robots typically refer to automated tools or scripts that interact with a web application or website to perform certain tasks without human intervention. These tools can be used for various purposes, such as:

    Web Crawling: Robots can be designed to explore and index content on a website by following links, similar to how search engines index pages. You might see web crawlers listed in a websiteâ€™s robots.txt file, which is a way for website owners to manage bot access and restrict certain bots from crawling their content.

    Web Scraping: They can extract data from websites by mimicking human interactions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, or downloading files. Web scraping bots can be found on websites that have public-facing data, such as e-commerce sites, news platforms, and social media, where bots extract and process large amounts of information.

    Automated Testing: Exploitation robots may simulate attacks or vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, or other attack vectors, to identify security weaknesses in a web application.

    Denial-of-Service (DoS): Some malicious robots are used to flood a web server with requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.

    Bots for Exploiting Vulnerabilities: In the context of web exploitation challenges (like CTFs), robots can be scripts or tools that automatically trigger certain vulnerabilities or execute exploits against web applications, such as sending crafted HTTP requests or manipulating cookies and headers to bypass security.
